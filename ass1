# ---------- Functions ----------

# 1️⃣ Function to find average marks
def average_score(marks):
    total = sum(marks)                    # Add all marks
    avg = total / len(marks)              # Divide by total students
    print("Average score of class:", avg)

# 2️⃣ Function to find highest and lowest marks
def highest_lowest(marks):
    high = max(marks)                     # Highest mark
    low = min(marks)                      # Lowest mark
    print("Highest score:", high)
    print("Lowest score:", low)

# 3️⃣ Function to count how many students were absent
def count_absent(marks):
    absent = marks.count(-1)              # Count of -1 means absent
    print("Number of students absent:", absent)

# 4️⃣ Function to find mark with highest frequency
def highest_frequency(marks):
    freq = {}                             # Empty dictionary to store frequencies
    for m in marks:
        if m != -1:                       # Skip absent students
            freq[m] = freq.get(m, 0) + 1  # Increase count of that mark

    # Get mark with maximum frequency
    most_common = max(freq, key=freq.get)
    print("Mark with highest frequency:", most_common)
    print("Frequency:", freq[most_common])


# ---------- Main Program ----------

    # Step 1: Ask total number of students
    n = int(input("Enter total number of students: "))

    # Step 2: Take marks input
    marks = []
    print("\nEnter marks of students (-1 for absent):")
    for i in range(n):
        mark = int(input(f"Student {i+1} mark: "))
        marks.append(mark)

    # Step 3: Call each function one by one
