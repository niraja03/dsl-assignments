Write functions to search whether a particular student attended the program or not using:

Binary Search

Fibonacci Search

Assignment 5

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program to store the First Year percentages of students in an array.
Write functions to sort the array of floating-point numbers in ascending order using:

Selection Sort

Bubble Sort
Display top five scores after sorting.

Assignment 6

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program to store the First Year percentages of students in an array.

Assignment 7

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program to sort a list of names based on their length using Bucket Sort.
Example Input:
["John", "Alexander", "Paul", "Victoria", "Mary", "Charles", "Elizabeth"]

🔗 CO3 – Linked Lists
Assignment 8

Problem Statement:
The Department of Computer Engineering has a student club named “Pinnacle Club”.
Students of 2nd, 3rd, and Final Year can become members.

The first node is reserved for the President

The last node is reserved for the Secretary

Write a C++ program using a Singly Linked List to:

Add and delete members (including President or Secretary)

Compute total number of members

Display all members

Concatenate two lists (for two divisions)

Assignment 9

Problem Statement:
A bookstore maintains a list of books with details:

Book ID (unique)

Title

Author

Price

Publication Year

Use a Doubly Linked List and implement functions to:

Add Book

Remove Book (by Book ID)

Search Book (by Book ID)

Update Book details (e.g., price)

Display all books in order of insertion

Find total number of books

🧱 CO4 – Stack
Assignment 10

Problem Statement:
In programming, syntax errors often occur due to unbalanced delimiters such as (), {}, [].
Write a C++ program using a Stack to check whether a given expression is well-parenthesized or not.

Assignment 11

Problem Statement:
Implement the Undo and Redo functionality using a stack.
Each operation (like typing or deleting a character) can be undone or redone.

Implement the following methods:

undo() – Undo the last operation

redo() – Redo the last undone operation

addOperation(op) – Add a new operation to the stack

⚙️ CO5 – Queue
Assignment 12

Problem Statement:
Queues are widely used in programming.
Example: An operating system’s job queue (processed in order of arrival).
Write a C++ program to simulate a job queue with functions to:

Add job

Delete job

Assignment 13

Problem Statement:
A printer handles multiple print jobs from different users.
Print jobs must be processed in order but in a round-robin manner so no user dominates.

Design a Circular Queue to manage print jobs.
Implement functions:

enqueue(job) – Add a new job

dequeue() – Process and remove front job

front() – Show job at front

isEmpty() – Check if queue is empty

isFull() – Check if queue is full

printJobCount() – Show total jobs in queue

Assignment 14

Problem Statement:
A Double-Ended Queue (Deque) allows insertion and deletion from both ends.
Write a C++ program using a one-dimensional array to simulate deque with functions to:

Add element (front or rear)

Delete element (front or rear)

Assignment 15

Problem Statement:
Given a Singly Linked List containing integers,
write a C++ program to reverse the order of nodes using a Stack.
